# tracing-app-kt-plugin
This plugin aims to standardize the tracing generated by the application using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) for tracing export.

## Supported:
[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)
[X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/xray/)

## Warning:
To use AWS X-Ray it is necessary to configure the aws credentials as an environment variable as per [docker-compose](templates/app/docker-compose.yml). The OpenTelemetry collector for aws needs to access the aws credentials.
